# Wonderland WordPress Theme

# Theme Instructions

* Install the 'Simple 301 Redirects' plugin by moving it to the 'plugins' folder (it's currently in the theme folder) to set up the Signature links. These can then be found under Settings  > 301 Redirects.
* Under Portfolio > Type, create AV, Print, Digital & Archive as Types.
* Under Pages, create About Wonderland & Archive.
* In About Wonderland, add the Find Us & Contact Us info in the relevant meta boxes. The main text goes in the main editor.
* The Archive page remains blank.
* When adding a new Portfolio Item, there are sections concerning each type (AV, Print & Digital). Fill these in with the relevant information for each type.
* Portfolio Items need a Featured image (675x330).
* Video poster images should be 640x360.
* Print images should be a maximum of 1000 pixels wide; they will be automatically scaled to fit the page.
* Choose the ordering for the media types under 'Media Order'. It doesn't matter if one or more sections are not present - these will not appear if not filled out or selected under Type.
* Add SEO description and keywords in each Portfolio Item for better search engine visibility.
